    * forgot password email sent
    * forgot password success
    * forgot password change password
* [forgot username](./umanage/forgot_username)
    * forgot username
    * forgot username email sent


Dependencies
============
* [django-core](https://github.com/InfoAgeTech/django-core) - provides a number of django related helpful utilities
* [markdown](https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown) - used for email template conversion so the emails have to be written only once without having to maintain a .txt and .html version.  The markdown version is the text email version.

Installation
============

    pip install django-umanage

Configuration
=============
1. Add to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your ``settings.py``:

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            ...
            'umanage',
            ...
        )

2. Add context processor to the ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`` in ``settings.py``:

        TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
            ...
            'umanage.context_processors.common',
            ...
        )

3. ``UMANAGE_FROM_EMAIL``: *required* setting is used when sending emails to users.  An example would be something like:

        UMANAGE_FROM_EMAIL = 'noreply@mysitedomain.com'

4. ``UMANAGE_BASE_TEMPLATE``: *required* setting that is the gateway into your app to keep a consistent look and feel with your site.  This setting is the path to that template.  For example:

        # base_umanage.html in templates directory
        {% extends 'path/to/my/app_template.html' %}
        
        {% block content %}
            {% comment %}umanage_content This is a required block{% endcomment %}
            {% block umanage_content %}{% endblock %}
        {% endblock %}

        # settings.py
        UMANAGE_BASE_TEMPLATE = 'base_umanage.html'

5. ``UMANAGE_BASE_UNAUTHENTICATED_TEMPLATE``: *optional* setting is similar to ``UMANAGE_BASE_TEMPLATE`` except this would be the base template for unauthenticated views.  This defaults to using the same value as ``UMANAGE_BASE_TEMPLATE``.

        # base_umanage.html in templates directory
        {% extends 'path/to/my/unauthenticated_app_template.html' %}
        
        {% block content %}
            {% comment %}umanage_content This is a required block{% endcomment %}
            {% block umanage_content %}{% endblock %}
        {% endblock %}

        # settings.py
        UMANAGE_BASE_UNAUTHENTICATED_TEMPLATE = 'base_umanage.html'

6. ``UMANAGE_FORM_RENDERER``: *optional* setting that allows your app to defined a location to a function that renders forms.  It can be any function that requires a single argument, the form object to render.  This defaults to calling django ``as_table()`` form rendering function.  For example, let's say I want to render forms using the [django-bootstrap-form](https://github.com/tzangms/django-bootstrap-form) app. Inside the app is a method to render forms called ``bootstrap(...)``.  So in the settings, I would define the for renderer as:

        UMANAGE_FORM_RENDERER = 'bootstrapform.templatetags.bootstrap.bootstrap'

7. ``UMANAGE_SITE_NAME``: required setting that is used as the signature as well as other places that refer to your site's name.

        UMANAGE_SITE_NAME = 'My Awesome Site'

8. ``UMANAGE_SITE_ROOT_URI``: required setting that is the root site uri for you site.  This is used to construct urls in emails that will link back to your site.

        UMANAGE_SITE_ROOT_URI = 'http://thisismydomain.com/'

9. ``urls.py``: Add desired urls to your ``urls.py`` file.   This app was designed so apps can inherit pieces of functionality or all functionality.  This was the reason that each use workflow has it's own folder. If all urls (workflows) are wanted, then add the following to your urls.py:

        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            url(r'', include('umanage.forgot_username.urls')),
            url(r'', include('umanage.forgot_password.urls')),
            url(r'^account', include('umanage.urls')),
        )
        
        # If that urls.py were expanded it could look something like
        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            url(r'', include('umanage.forgot_username.urls')),
            url(r'', include('umanage.forgot_password.urls')),
            url(r'^account', include('umanage.activate_account.urls')),
            url(r'^account', include('umanage.change_email.urls')),
            url(r'^account', include('umanage.change_password.urls')),
            url(r'^account/token-expired/?$', TokenExpiredView.as_view(), name='umanage_token_expired'),
        )

For a configuration example, look at the tests [settings.py](/InfoAgeTech/django-umanage/blob/master/tests/settings.py) file.
